There are four code notebooks for the project.Merging datasets_EagleBine and Merging datasets_Duvernay files explain the dataset merging workflow for both the basin respectively. Basic EDA and spatial mapping shows intial data exploration vizualization and spatial mapping for EagleBine and Duvrnay basins. Machine learning modelling_NN notebook compiles code for Neural network modelling for EagleBine and Duvernay data sets.
